    "## Defining 2D Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "A 2D array is a way of storing data similar to a table with rows and columns, created by storing multiple arrays inside of a parent array. Just like a spreadsheet, where each cell can be identified by its row and column number, elements in a 2D array can be accessed using their respective row and column indices. This organization allows for efficient storage and retrieval of data in a structured format, making it particularly useful for tasks involving tabular data or grids.\n",

    "For example, take a 2D array initialized like this (more on how to initialize later):\n",
    "\n",

    "In Java, you can initialize a 2D array using various methods, depending on your requirements and preferences. Here are some common approaches:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using Array Initializer\n",
    "\n",
    "You can directly initialize a 2D array using an array initializer. This method is suitable when you know the values of the array elements at compile time. An important thing to note is that you can actually create 2D arrays with 1D arrays of varying lengths, adding more complexity to the 2D array that can be useful in some scenarios.\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int[][] array2D = {\n",
    "    {1, 2, 3},\n",

    "    {7, 8, 9}\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initializing with default values\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a new 2D array with a set number of rows and columns with preset values:\n",
    "- `null` for reference types (i.e. String, char, boolean)\n",
    "- `0` for numeric types (i.e. int, double, float)\n",
    "\n",
    "```java\n",
    "int rows = 2;\n",
    "int columns = 2;\n",
    "int[][] array2D = new int[rows][columns];\n",

    "Means of traversing and interacting with 2D arrays are relatively specific in the context of one College Board problem (i.e., iterate through to determine a condition about a row, find a value in a row, search columns by condition, etc.), so make sure to analyze the context to determine if a certain method may be used again to abstract what would otherwise be a more complex task in a future method. With practice, this connection should be obvious.\n",
