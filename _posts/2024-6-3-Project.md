## Key Interests and Coding Intersection
My passion lies in using technology to improve students' learning experiences. I am particularly interested in how data analysis and machine learning can help personalize learning experiences for individual students. The Nighthawk Coders internship presents an ideal opportunity for me to apply my current ideals and innovations while also expanding my skills.


## Student Communication System:
Developed a Web app that allows students to communicate with each other and search for jobs, internships, and other educational opportunities.
Allowed students to communicate in a large group chat or a direct messaging basis.
Used APIs to search through different internship, job and other education opportunities
Included a ChatGPT-based AI system to communicate with the student to answer any questions they might have.

## Teamwork Methodologies
I have utilized Agile methodologies such as Scrum and other communication methods such as Slack and Discord to manage and collaborate on my various projects. This has allowed me to thrive in team environments, ensuring clear communication and efficient project management as well as the success of other team members.

## Full Stack and ML Experience
I have hands-on experience in full-stack development, particularly with Python, Java, JavaScript, and various database systems. Additionally, I have worked on machine learning projects that involve data analysis and predictive modeling, enhancing my ability to create intelligent educational tools.

## Showcase Events
I recently participated in the N@tM event in May 2024, where I presented a Farming+NBA Sports Betting game.
I also participated in a prior N@TM event in which I presented the functionality of the aforementioned Student Communication System

## Unique Qualifications
What sets me apart is my ability to blend technical skills with a deep understanding of educational needs. My experience in creating personalized educational tools aligns perfectly with the goals of the Nighthawk Coding Society.
