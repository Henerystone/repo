On this quiz, I got 16/40. To ensure a better score on the AP Exam, I am correcting these mistakes.

- It seems the main reason I got these questions wrong is because I did not thoroughly read the code and the question to understand how it works. Instead, I rushed blindly, clicking on the answer that seemed to be the most likely to be the answer.


- In order to avoid this, I need to read the code and the questions asked for longer and not press the answer button until I am sure that the answer is correct.

- The topics I got the most wrong on are the 1st and 2nd units. This is suprising as I had studied those two the most. Again, it comes down to my understanding of the question and how well I interpreted it.
- Looking back, I should have studied the topics more by watching the videos and finding some practice MCs on the internet to solve.

- Another thing that confused me was the 4th topic. The subjects introduced in it threw me off due to my familiarity with the Python version of looping. Although very similar, the Java version of iteration seems to be subtly diffrent from the other version of it, confusing me and leading me to choose the wrong answer.
