# Site modification
> To start, this site was forked from the student website of Mr. Mortensen. I then deleted several files stored on the site and replaced them with my own, modifying the style of the blog and the layout.

> To run the site, I ran a few commands provided in the original blog to install a few Jekyll and Gem components and then ran a make server command to get the website running.

> To modify, I added an About me page and removed the csse and csp pages. I also renamed the blog tab to Shreyas Sarurkar's Blog
