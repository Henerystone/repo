- This trimester in CSA has been very productive and informative for me. I learnt several diffrent computer topics such as traversing arraylists, looping, 2D arrays, recursion all in java, a completely new coding language that I took on while having no previous experience with the language.

- In this trimester, I made new friends, learnt new things, and explored the vast worlds of Computer Science in further depth.

- While I was gaining new knowledge, however, I made quite a few mistakes which I intend to correct in the following Trimesters. I learnt to stay sharp and alert, to finish my work faster and with more quality and depth. I also learnt to take more risks with my goals, to set larger milestones and take larger leaps. I learnt that in order to really delve into this world, I need to take on larger projects and allow my imagination to take over the design process.

- I realised that I need to progress further during Night At The Museum, where I got to interact with my fellow classmates projects and I noticed that many of them were incredibly large undertakings which were accomplished via a strong team bond and an incredibly focused group.

- I was blown away by projects such as the Rasberry PI robot and the Current Mood Detector. These projects were much more advanced than what I thought they would be. I was expecting projects that were similar to the ones last year, in CSP. That, however, was not the case; most of the projects were incredibly well made, using a complex blend of all the code that we had learnt in the past years. They used CSS and SASS to detail their sites down to the last pixel, they used Javascript and HTML beautifully to give their websites life and functionality, they used JAVA to build the bones of their sites and store all their data. Most importantly, they used incredible creativity to power their entire process, making the website seem like it was made by a million-dollar company rather than a group of 16-year olds. 

- This advanced understanding of coding seen in my peers has enlightened me to strive to do better than what I am already doing and collaborate with my team members better to express my creativity and spread my ideas.

- Although there were many takeaways, this trimester was very fun and I hope to keep learning and growing in my next two trimesters in CSA, both of which I hope to implement my new-found knowledge in.
